    "the numerator. The hazard function is\n",
    "also called the *force of mortality*,\n",

    "deaths and the\n",
    "population at risk for those deaths. Loosely speaking, the\n",
    "probability density\n",
    "function in the numerator represents the probability of a\n",
    "death occurring in a\n",

    "unqualified deaths, but only deaths that can happen\n",

    "event. This means that the hazard rate for any\n",
    "particular individual is small.\n",
    "On the other hand, if there are only two\n",
    "subjects in the life raft and the\n",
    "probability of falling off is 3/4, then the\n",

    "Consider a subject whose survival time is 5 years. For this subject to have died\n",
    "at\n",
    "the fifth year, it had to be alive during the fourth year. Thus, the *hazard*\n",
    "at\n",
    "5 years is the failure rate per-year, conditioned on the fact that the\n",
    "subject\n",
    "survived until the fourth year. Note that this is *not* the same as the\n",
    "unconditional failure rate per year at the fifth year, because the unconditional\n",
    "rate applies to all units at time zero and does not use information about\n",
